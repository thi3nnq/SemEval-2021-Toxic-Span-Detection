Paying over 50% of your income on taxes is insane.

More so for other countries like Ireland, Singapore, Hong Kong, etc.  That gap is going to get wider as Trump is going to lower taxes.  It now looks like Junior may impose higher capital gains taxes which again is stupid as many high tech staff count stock share options as part of their pay.

Plaster was a major thing - it has ZERO survival value. It takes days of backbreaking labour, maintaining a fire at very high heat constantly - for no reward other than aesthetics.
